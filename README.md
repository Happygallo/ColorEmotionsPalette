# About

Think for a few seconds on the last emotions or feelings you have had in the last days, express those emotions with emojis and then convert them into your own Color Emotions Palette to use them anywhere you want. This is the project I made for the WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge. It's completely made with SwiftUI, and I am very happy I achieved to sent it. I know I have many things to learn and I am open to any comments.
